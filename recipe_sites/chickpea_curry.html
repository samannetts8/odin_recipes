    <p><u><strong>Recipe</strong></u></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Halve, peel and chop the red onion into small pieces. Peel the sweet potato and chop into 2cm chunks. Peel and grate the garlic (or use a garlic press). Zest and cut the lime into wedges. Drain and rinse the chickpeas in a sieve.</li>

        <li>Pour cold water for the rice into a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Stir in the rice and 1/4 tsp salt and bring to the boil on medium-high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium and cover with the lid. Leave to cook for 10 mins, then remove the pan from the heat (still covered) and leave to the side for another 10 mins or until ready to serve (the rice will continue to cook in its own steam).</li>

        <li>While the rice cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the onion and stir-fry until softened, 3-4 mins.</li>

        <li>Stir in the yellow Thai style paste and half the garlic. Cook for 1 min more. Stir in the sweet potato and chickpeas, then pour in 300ml water for the curry, veg stock paste, coconut milk and peanut butter. Stir to thoroughly combine, 2-3 mins. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Pop the lid on and simmer, stirring frequently until the sweet potato is tender, 15-20 mins. TIP: Add a splash more water if you feel it needs it.</li>

        <li>About 6-8 mins before your curry is ready, heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat. When hot, add the spinach a handful at a time and allow it to wilt slightly, 1-2 mins. Once it begins to wilt, add the ketjap manis and remaining garlic and stir-fry until some of the liquid has evaporated, 2-3 mins. Remove from the heat once wilted and piping hot.</li>

        <li>Fluff up the rice with a fork and stir through the lime zest. Add a squeeze of lime juice to the curry, then taste and add more salt, pepper and lime juice if needed. Share the rice between your bowls and spoon the curry onto one side with the garlic spinach on the other. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over. Enjoy!</li>

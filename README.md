I have completed this project as a part of the School of Code pre-course learning materials. This was done to cement what I have learnt about HTML in the process, and combines my news skills in realising the correct Document Type so the browser can read it, ensuring the meta data in the code is appropriately labelled, and the title of the site is correct.

Additionally, I was able to demonstrate my ability to set up hyperlinks to new webpages where I included more formatted examples of text on the site, as well as ordered lists, unordered lists, and images.

I hope this meets the criteria of the project, and I welcome any feedback as to how I can improve!
